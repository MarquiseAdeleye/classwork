         * A method starts with a method signature which idetifies the name of the method, what type of data it
         * returns, and what data it will accept for processing
         *
         * Method signature: return-type Name(data it will accept)
         *
         * return-type == the type of data returned from the method
         *                 use void if the method does not return data
         * Name() == Name of the method - Method names are in PascalCase
         *                                PascalCase - The first letter of every word is Capitalized
