                Detail-oriented and driven software engineer with three years of development
                experience and over five years in technical roles. A graduate of Grand Circus
                in Detroit and the Apple Developer Academy, I have a strong foundation in
                C#/.NET and a growing focus on cybersecurity. I'm passionate about building
                secure, scalable tools that help engineering teams proactively identify and
                mitigate security risks—aligning with modern DevSecOps practices. As cyber
                threats evolve, I’m committed to contributing to robust security tooling,
                supporting secure-by-design principles, and staying current through hands-on
                projects and industry certifications. My 3–5 year goal is to advance into a
                mid-level engineering role where I can continue building secure systems that
                protect users and organizations alike.
